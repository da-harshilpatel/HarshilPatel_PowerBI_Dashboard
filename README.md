# PowerBI Dashboard: Superstore Sales


## Data Transformation and Cleaning
Data transformation and cleaning are essential to prepare the dataset for analysis. The tasks performed include:

1. **Removing Duplicates**: Identified and removed any duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Addressed missing values through imputation or exclusion based on the context.
3. **Standardizing Formats**: Ensured consistency in date formats, text cases, and numerical entries.
4. **Data Validation**: Applied rules to maintain data accuracy and quality.
5. **Filtering**: Removed irrelevant data to focus on the most meaningful insights.

## Loading Data
The cleaned and transformed data was then loaded into PowerBI. The steps involved were:

1. **Importing Data**: Imported the dataset from various sources such as Excel, CSV, or databases.
2. **Previewing Data**: Checked the data preview to ensure proper loading without errors.

## Changing Column Types
Ensuring that columns are in the correct format is crucial for accurate analysis. The following tasks were performed:

1. **Data Type Adjustment**: Changed column types to appropriate formats (e.g., dates, numbers, text).
2. **Formatting**: Applied proper formatting to columns to enhance readability and usability.
3. **Custom Formatting**: Implemented custom formats where standard options were insufficient.

## Creating New Columns and Measures
To enrich the dataset and enhance analysis, new columns and measures were created:

1. **Calculated Columns**: Added columns with calculated values to derive new insights (e.g., profit margins, sales growth).
2. **DAX Measures**: Created measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate metrics like total sales, average sales, and year-over-year growth.
3. **Hierarchies**: Developed hierarchies to enable drill-downs and detailed analysis.
